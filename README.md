# Synapse BPM 2.0 on WEB 3.0

Integrated IA on worflow creations, agents and decisions evolution on the BPM schema and creation, work in progress...

This document will be written when features are clear and potential of IA will be defined and confined in rational perimeter of the project.
We will use automation code generation to improve code quality of existing code and future code, all generated code will be under copyright and protected as all the existing and future manual code of the application.
To access the source code of the app, you have to request access to the authors or to C-Tronik company by website or via email. This is a new concept different by open or closed source... It is "request source", a new concept to intend software
born for many reasons.... We will explain this new concept in detail on the portal www.c-tronik.com and www.c-tronik.it. 'Open source' don't allow the right gain to authors and closed source don't allow the security of the software and
privacy of the user at all...... So no one of this type of licencing model is correct and sustainable over time. With the coming of IA this is the time and a epoc where this problems are serious and actual, after years and decades the
problem is real and at its end, now we can affirm that this models are not working as expected, after 30 years of full expansion of internet (6 agoust 1991 the first web site go online), and consequently a new way of accessing information 
much more powerful than any existing modality with unlimited possibilities of knowing and understanding by anyone with access to the Internet, open source and cloded source companies at all levels and high scale world wide and local in 
small companies, all this models are full of problems with no resolutions. Open source means a life like you don't deserve, just as specialized programming work should reward the release of valuable software, on the opposite, the closed-source 
model may earn the developers involved a fair amount, but in reality it represents only tenths or hundredths of the actual earnings of companies and their owners. More serious is the potential violation of user privacy and the lack of software 
security guaranteed by the lack of code transparency... This problems that cannot be solved without access to the source code of software products, or gaining money for developers can not be solved without selling also source code or copyright 
or royalties or other type of compensation on software selling gains. The new model we propose (Request Source) fully solves both problems, with the sole condition of rewarding the work performed and ensuring its care in preserving, documenting, 
and then making it accessible upon request to anyone with an interest in or right to access the software sources, free of charge under certain conditions (conditions listed in the blueprint documents on the website www.c-tronik.com and www.c-tronik.it).
